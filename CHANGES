0.9.1
-----

gevent can now be compiled with libevent-1.3 (Thanks to Litao Wei for reporting the problem.)

Hub now tries to silently recover after event_dispatch() failures (I've seen this happen
even though event_reinit() is called as necessary). The end result is that fork() now works
more reliably, as detected by test_socketserver.py - it used to fail occasionally, now it does not.

The package was reorganized, most of the stuff from gevent/__init__.py was moved to gevent/greenlet.py.
gevent/__init__.py imports some of it back but not everything.

gevent.timeout was renamed to gevent.Timeout.

Fixed a few bugs in queue.Queue.
Add test_queue.py from standard tests to check how good is gevent.queue.Queue a replacement
for a standard Queue (not good at all, timeouts in put() don't work yet)

monkey: patches ssl module when on 2.6 (very limited support).

Improved compatibility with Python 2.6 and Python 2.4.

Greenlet installed from PyPI (without py.magic prefix) is properly recognized now.

core.pyx was accidentally left out of the source package, it's included now.

GreenSocket now wraps a socket object from _socket module rather than from socket.


0.9.0
-----

Started as eventlet 0.8.11 spin-off, with intention to support only libevent as a backend.
Compared to eventlet, this version has a much simpler API and implementation and a few
severe bugs fixed, namely
 - full duplex in sockets, i.e. read() and write() on the same fd do not cancel one another
 - GreenSocket.close() does not hang as it could with eventlet
(there's a test in my repo of eventlet that reproduces both of them:
http://bitbucket.org/denis/eventlet/src/tip/greentest/test__socket.py)
