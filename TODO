- try to use names from standard library where possible
- if monkey patching thread module also patch threading.local
- nonblocking DNS calls via libevent
- move Semaphore and BoundedSemaphore from coros to another module; deprecate coros
- fix BoundedSemaphore to behave like standard threading's BoundedSemaphore behaves:
  raise ValueError if upper limit is reached instead of blocking.
- HUB and MAINLOOP - same thing, choose one name and use it everywhere
